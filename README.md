# CS 225 Final Project Repo for SIG

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to analyze a social media network, given a node-edge dataset. Specifically, we wanted to find a profile (node) with the most connections (edges) with other profiles in a given network graph using DFS, Betweenness Centrality, and Page Rank algorithms.

## Running Instructions 

### Prerequisites
- Ensure that you are in the root directory.

### Main
```bash
make
```
```bash
./main [input_dataset_path] [number_of_nodes] [output_file_name]
```
Run Facebook Network Analysis: <code>./main dataset/facebook_combined.txt 4039 [output_file_name]</code>
<br>
Output file will be located in [output](output) directory with the name inputted.

## Test Suite
```bash
make test
./test
```
### Available Arguments for Tests
- `parse` tests with all sample datasets
- `dfs` tests with all sample datasets
- `betweenness` test betweenness centrality algorithm
- `pagerank` test pagerank algorithm

Running Tests with Argument Example: <code>./test [parse]</code>
