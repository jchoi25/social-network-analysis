### Comments

The proposal is very well written, and it sounds to be a very interesting project. Unfortunately, there are two major flaws in your algorithm part. Also, I do like the clean pdf format, but the proposal is supposed to be in .md file.

**Algorithm**

- The Dijkstra's algorthm requires edge weights, and notice that constant or random egde weights are not allowed for any covered algorithms, since it will essentially be an unweighted graph (all covered algorithms require weights). Thus, could you update on how you plan to assign meaningful edge weights on your graph for the Dijkstra's algorthm?

- Landmark algorithm is not allowed for uncovered algorithms anymore since it is essential two Dijkstra's algorithm. Could you come up with another uncovered algorithm?
