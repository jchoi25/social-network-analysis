## Communication

1. **Team Meetings:** Weekly team meetings will be held every Thursday at 9PM in person. Each meeting will last around 1.5 hours, but will be flexible according to what needs to be done or discussed in that meeting. In special circumstances, meetings can also be done online through Zoom. 
2. **Assistance:** All members are in a group chat to be in contact with each other for any opinions or feedback. Members are expected to respond as soon as possible, in 2-4 hours at most, at least a sign that they have read the message. 
3. **Respect:** All members need to come to a full agreement on ideas regarding the project. Members have agreed to speak to voice their opinions and contribute to discussions and brainstorming when ideas are needed or conflicts arise.

## Collaboration

1. **Work Distribution:** All members are expected to participate equally in work and understand how each part of the project (i.e. algorithms and workflow) works. Tasks will be distributed according to each member’s strengths and weaknesses every week. If a member does not have a specific work assigned for the week, they are expected to review and debug other members’ work. Contents in the weekly development logs will be discussed in weekly meetings and be written there.
2. **Time Commitment:** There is no set time commitment, however, each member should try their best to meet weekly goals and finish their weekly task. Members will notify the group when there are conflicts or problems or finish the task early for the work to possibly be reviewed by others, ideally before the weekly meeting.
3. **Conflict Resolution:** Members will meet to discuss when conflicts/disagreements arise to compromise. Before rejecting a member’s idea, a valid reason and an alternative idea will need to be presented. For conflicts regarding the project work, members will ask the project mentor for an opinion, if cannot be resolved within the group. When a member does not do their part persistently or is habitually late, all members will meet to address the issue and alert the assigned project mentor, if it cannot be resolved within the group.
