    Nice presentation! The contents are very well organized. The audio volumn was not very consistent between each speakers, but it was understandable, so that was ok. It was nice that you spent lots of time explaining tests and doing analysis, but it would be even better if you could visualized some of the test cases. Well done.

    The report was concise and well written. I saw that for each algorithm you showed the results of sample outputs, but it would be better if you could explain which kind of test was it, and how could this test show the code worked.
