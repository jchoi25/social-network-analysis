> **Communication**
>
> ❖ Team Meetings: Weekly team meetings will be held every Thursday at
> 9PM inperson. Each meeting will last around 1.5 hours, but will be
> ﬂexible according to what needs to be done or discussed in that
> meeting. In special circumstances, meetings can also be done online
> through Zoom.
>
> ❖ Assistance: All members are in a group chat to be in contact with
> each other for any opinions or feedback. Members are expected to
> respond as soon as possible, in 2-4 hours at most, at least a sign
> that they have read the message.❖ Respect: All members need to come to
> a full agreement on ideas regarding the project. Members have agreed
> to speak to voice their opinions and contribute to discussions and
> brainstorming when ideas are needed or conﬂicts arise.
>
> **Collaboration**
>
> ❖ Work Distribution: All members are expected to participate equally
> in work and understand how each part of the project (i.e. algorithms
> and workﬂow) works.
>
> Tasks will be distributed according to each member's strengths and
> weaknesses every week. If a member does not have a speciﬁc work
> assigned for the week, they are expected to review and debug other
> members' work. Contents in the weekly development logs will be
> discussed in weekly meetings and be written there.
>
> ❖ Time Commitment: There is no set time commitment, however, each
> member should try their best to meet weekly goals and ﬁnish their
> weekly task. Members will notify the group when there are conﬂicts or
> problems or ﬁnish the task early for the work to possibly be reviewed
> by others, ideally before the weekly meeting.❖ Conﬂict Resolution:
> Members will meet to discuss when conﬂicts/disagreements arise to
> compromise. Before rejecting a member's idea, a valid reason and an
> alternative idea will need to be presented. For conﬂicts regarding the
> project work, members will ask the project mentor for an opinion, if
> cannot be resolved within the group. When a member does not do their
> part persistently or is
>
> habitually late, all members will meet to address the issue and alert
> the assigned project mentor, if it cannot be resolved within the
> group.
