### Week March 28 ~ April 3

PASS

I have updated your proposal and contract grades. It is ok to not have too much progress this week, but make sure to have enough to share by the mid-checkin.

### Week April 4 ~ April 10

PASS (improvement on dev log is needed)

Nice work. You guys should be on the right track. For the mid-checkin, remember to write test cases for your data parsinga and traversal functions. Try to use some small dataset/graphs to verify your implementations. Also, please try to elaborate on your weekly progress in your dev log next week. Other than that, I am looking forward to see your results.

### Week April 4 ~ April 10

PASS

Nice progress. I went over your test case, which I assume is used for the data parsing. I would suggest you to include more test cases for data parsing and BFS. For example, manually create a txt file that contains only few nodes and edges as a mini dataset, and see if your parsing and BFS works on this small graph. This is much more managable and easy to debug. Remember, we will check for test cases for both data parsing and traversal algorithms in both mid-checkin and final delivery.

### Week April 18 - April 24

PASS

Nice work. Good job on the mid-checkin.

### Week April 25 - May 1

PASS

Couple reminders for the final delivery:
- READ THE RUBRIC VERY CAREFULLY! (I am more than willing to give partial credits, but I cannot give out points that are clearly missing based on the rubric)
- In README, Make sure to mention how to run, compile, and test your code, and also where are all the files
- In write up, remember to decripe your algorithms' input/ouput, and problem solved by your algorithms. Explain the runtime of your algorithms.
- For your code, make sure your code can compile and run. There should be comments throught the code, and not junk codes.
- For the presentation, discuss your goal, method used, and individuals' conclusion thoughs. A powerpoint will be nice.
