### Week March 28 ~ April 3

PASS

I have updated your proposal and contract grades. It is ok to not have too much progress this week, but make sure to have enough to share by the mid-checkin.

### Week April 4 ~ April 10

PASS (improvement on dev log is needed)

Nice work. You guys should be on the right track. For the mid-checkin, remember to write test cases for your data parsinga and traversal functions. Try to use some small dataset/graphs to verify your implementations. Also, please try to elaborate on your weekly progress in your dev log next week. Other than that, I am looking forward to see your results.

### Week April 4 ~ April 10

PASS

Nice progress. I went over your test case, which I assume is used for the data parsing. I would suggest you to include more test cases for data parsing and BFS. For example, manually create a txt file that contains only few nodes and edges as a mini dataset, and see if your parsing and BFS works on this small graph. This is much more managable and easy to debug. Remember, we will check for test cases for both data parsing and traversal algorithms in both mid-checkin and final delivery.

### Week April 18 - April 24

PASS

Nice work. Good job on the mid-checkin.
