### Week March 28 ~ April 3

PASS

I have updated your proposal and contract grades. It is ok to not have too much progress this week, but make sure to have enough to share by the mid-checkin.

### Week April 4 ~ April 10

PASS (improvement on dev log is needed)

Nice work. You guys should be on the right track. For the mid-checkin, remember to write test cases for your data parsinga and traversal functions. Try to use some small dataset/graphs to verify your implementations. Also, please try to elaborate on your weekly progress in your dev log next week. Other than that, I am looking forward to see your results.
